# Example files for processing data from the GE Signa PET/MR
This should also work for dat from GE PET/CT scanners using the RDF9 file format

Check the [howto.md](howto.md) for a description. In addition, there are some
(rather horrible) scripts that might help.

Currently missing is the attenuation processing. One reason for this is that
the attenuation currently still needs manual flipping and rotation.

As an example, we also provide complete processing of the data from the GE PET/MR
spatial calibration phantom (called VQC), available from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3887517).
